00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420
Dave: I sent this application

00:00:01.444 --> 00:00:02.785
form weeks ago through your

00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:04.000
very confusing website,

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:05.489
and I haven't heard back, and I want

00:00:05.513 --> 00:00:07.000
to book contractors before the end of

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.000
the summer to build my dock.

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.000
What is going on with it?

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.532
Morgan: Sir, I apologize.

00:00:12.556 --> 00:00:14.266
We are just looking for your

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.000
application because it may

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:16.805
not have gone to the

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:17.797
right person for review.

00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:19.000
Thank you for your patience

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.000
while I keep searching.

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.117
Dave: I don't even know

00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:22.588
if I need a regulatory

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:23.555
review or not.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.000
I am just doing this

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.121
so I don't get into trouble.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.488
What happens if I just skip it

00:00:28.512 --> 00:00:30.000
and carry on with my project?

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.489
Morgan: I'm sorry, only a biologist can assess

00:00:32.513 --> 00:00:35.000
your applications and advise if you

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.855
need a review, but I have escalated

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.000
your request and the person responsible

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:40.911
for your application will contact you

00:00:40.923 --> 00:00:43.000
within 10 business days with an answer .

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.353
If you do proceed with your project

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:48.000
before we assess your application, you

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.000
will risk fines and damage to fish habitat.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:53.000
Dave: I have to wait two more weeks!

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.000
Unbelievable!
