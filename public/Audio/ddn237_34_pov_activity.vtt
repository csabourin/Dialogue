00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.400
I sent this application form weeks ago through

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.800
your very confusing website and I haven't heard

3
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.900
back and I want to book contractors' before

4
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.200
the end of the summer to build my

5
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.001
dock. What is going on with it? 

6
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.200
Sir, I apologize. We are just looking for your

7
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.300
application because it may not have gone to

8
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.600
the right person for review.

9
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.000
Thank you for your patience.

10
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.600
While I keep searching, I don't even know

11
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.800
if I need a regulatory review or not.

12
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.500
I am just doing this, so I don't

13
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.300
get into trouble.

14
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.900
What happens if I just skip it and

15
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.200
carry on with my project?

16
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.600
I'm sorry. Only a biologist can assess your

17
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.000
applications and advise if you need a review.

18
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.400
But I have escalated your request and the

19
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.300
person responsible for your application.

20
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.300
I will contact you within ten business days

21
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.100
with an answer.

22
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.600
If you do proceed with your project.

23
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.200
Before we assess your application, you will risk

24
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.300
fines and damage to fish habitat.

25
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.700
I have to wait two more weeks.

26
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.600
Unbelievable.
