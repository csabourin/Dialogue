00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
<strong>Claudine</strong>: Morgan? Do you have that draft ready?

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.000
Wow. What's wrong?

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.900
You look stressed.

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.100
Sorry. I feel like every week this summer.

5
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.500
I keep getting calls from people trying to

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.900
get information on their read review application.

7
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.500
And the data isn't coded correctly because people

8
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.600
keep submitting the wrong forms for their project.

9
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.700
So I have to search for everything manually.

10
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.900
It's starting to become a real pain, okay.

11
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.900
But the real priority is that engagement paper.

12
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.400
It's the end of the fiscal year.

13
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.900
And we have a hard deadline.

14
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.500
I realised that, but the only way to

15
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.200
stop people from calling me is to try

16
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.400
to give them an answer about their applications.

17
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.100
But I can bear only do that because

18
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.700
no one has time to sort through them.

19
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.600
I feel like it's a full time job

20
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.700
keeping up with these applications and most of

21
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.800
them were not even needed.

22
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.700
We should be sending people back to the

23
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.700
website to read through the documents, everything about

24
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.800
the process. And the regulatory frameworks is explained

25
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.900
there if we don't deliver this paper soon,

26
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.100
I will need to report to the AGM

27
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.800
that we're going to miss the deadline.

28
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.900
And this isn't looking good for us to

29
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.800
be fair at the site's navigation tion and

30
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.300
search function isn't the greatest people also need

31
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.100
help in translating some of the jargon.

32
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.400
It's not really easy to understand.

33
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.200
I don't have time to both guide people

34
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.600
through the process and write this engagement paper

35
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.200
draft. I don't know what to do!
